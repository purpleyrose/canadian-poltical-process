# The Canadian Poltical Process

## Introduction

This is a game that is based on _The Political Process_, but readapted for Canadian Politics. This game is almost entirely text-based and data driven, and is made using Godot and .NET. A special thanks to my computer science teacher, who encouraged me to make this game, and to my friend, Jack, who helped me playtest this game.
